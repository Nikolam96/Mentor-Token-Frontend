The Mentor Token project is designed to connect small businesses and startups with experienced mentors who can offer valuable advice and leadership in areas such as finance, business growth, and management. The goal is to facilitate meaningful connections and provide tailored guidance to help businesses thrive.

For the frontend, I used React with React Query to efficiently manage data fetching and state synchronization. I implemented React Router to handle seamless navigation across various pages and sections of the platform. Additionally, I incorporated Chart.js for visual data representation, Toastify for notifications, and other third-party libraries to enhance the overall user experience.
